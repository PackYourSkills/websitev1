# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      maxime: "The geek of the duet, he is as creative as passionate about strategy, company culture and management. Full of enthusiasm and resolutely optimistic, he keeps the flame of ideas burning so that Pack Your Skills remains dynamic. With his dreams of changing the world and a parisian green and « bobo » (bourgeois-bohemian) lifestyle, he likes alternative places and attends events on social and solidarity economy as often as he can. When he needs to let go a bit, you’ll find him with a fresh beer in his hands, in a music gig or at the top of a mountain !"
      isis: "Bathing in the web and startup environment since she started her studies, she majored in Marketing and is passionate about self-actualization. The younger of the duet, she yet is the one who makes everything we imagine possible by going into details of the execution. She reads a lot, likes hiking in the nature, and cannot prevent herself from having several projects in mind. As she care about her 8-hours sleep and her personal balance, she prefers to sharpen her efectiveness rather than spending long ineffective hours of work."
