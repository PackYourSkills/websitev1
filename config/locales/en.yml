# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

With his dreams of changing the world and a parisian green and « bobo » (bourgeois-bohemian) lifestyle, he likes alternative places and attends events on social and solidarity economy as often as he can. When he needs to let go a bit, you’ll find him with a fresh beer in his hands, in a music gig or at the top of a mountain !"

The younger of the duet, she yet is the one who makes everything we imagine possible by going into details of the execution. She reads a lot, likes hiking in the nature, and cannot prevent herself from having several projects in mind. As she care about her 8-hours sleep and her personal balance, she prefers to sharpen her efectiveness rather than spending long ineffective hours of work."

    title: "Who are the Packers?"
    q1: 'WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A « PACKER » ?'
    a1_html: 'Packers are people from all over the world, whatever their age, who want to travel differently. They want to mix with the local culture and rope their skills in to feel useful during their trip.<br><br>With Pack Your Skills, Packers can volunteer to help local entrepreneurs (whom we call « Crews ») during their trip. In exchange for their help, they are hosted and fed by the entrepreneur or someone from his team. Both moments, professional and social, are a great opportunity to discover the local culture and entrepreneurial ecosystem.<br><br>Pack Your Skills sources projects who need help and have them put offers online on www.packyourskills.com, where Packers can see them and apply. We only choose entrepreneurs who are more concerned about solving a problem and having a positive impact than making tons of money.'
    q2: 'WHY DO WE CALL THEM « PACKERS » ?'
    a2_html: 'The name « Packers » comes from « to pack », a verb related to traveling (pack your bag, backpackers…). As pretty clear in our name, the idea is to « pack your skills » with all the other stuff in your bag, and to come use them during your trip.'
    q3: 'HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO BE A PACKER ?'
    a3_html: 'For legal reasons, Packers need to become members of our association. To do so, they need to pay for a yearly 10€ subscription.<br><br> The traveling expenses (airplane, bus, Visa…) are at the expense of the Packer.'
    q4: 'WHAT IS THE PROCESS TO BECOME A PACKER ?'
    a4_html: 'The first step to becoming a Packer is to Sign Up. <br>Once you’ve signed up, you will be able to fill your profile to prepare your future application.<br>We are working with the future hosting projects and the opportunities will be online very soon. You will be able to see the list and apply to those you like. <br>...and get ready, we will open a new European city in 2018'

  iamacrew:
    title: "Who are the Crews?"
    q1: 'WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A « CREW » ?'
    a1_html: 'Crews are teams whose primary concern is to solve a problem and have a positive impact, and not making tons of money. They have projects they cannot conduct because they lack skills, time or money.<br><br>With Pack Your Skills, they can have someone (whom we call « Packer ») help on this project with his/her skills. In exchange for this volunteer help, Crews are asked to provide food and accommodation. Packers are foreigners who come help during their trip, so the whole experience is a great opportunity to meet someone from another culture, get a fresh viewpoint, and break from routine.'
    q2: 'WHY DO WE CALL THEM « CREWS » ?'
    a2_html: 'The name « Crews » refers to the teams of sailors who get on a boat to live and work together for a limited journey. For us, the teams who welcome Packers are like those crews because they form an ephemeral team for a limited time, to accomplish a specific mission together.'
    q3: 'HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO BE A CREW ?'
    a3_html: 'Pack Your Skills’ business model is based on the financial participation of Crews. Since 2017 is our first year, we are testing different things. As we wanted to be inclusive and see how much Crews valued our service, we didn’t fix a price. Each Crew can choose the price he wants to pay for our work.<br>In addition, for the Packer, the Crew is asked to provide or pay for :<br>- 3 meals a day<br>- the transportation between the apartment where the Packer is hosted, and the workplace.'
    q4: 'WHAT IS THE PROCESS TO BECOME A CREW ?'
    a4_html: 'The first step to becoming a Crew is to book call with Maxime from our team. <br>After the call, the team will decide if you correspond to the type of projects we’re looking for. <br>If you do and are based in Paris, we will put your offer online. If you’re not based in Paris, we will need to discuss further because we haven’t opened other cities than Paris yet.'
